##### OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

- Consider implementing OAuth 2.0 for authorization and OpenID Connect for authentication
- These protocols are well-suited for web and mobile applications and provide features like Single Sign-On (SSO) and token-based authentication.
##### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

- JWTs can be used as authentication tokens and are commonly used in combination with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
- They can be used to carry user identity and authentication information.
##### Token-Based Authentication

- Implement token-based authentication using technologies like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which allow secure transmission of user identity information between the client and server
- Tokens are often more scalable and portable than traditional session-based authentication
##### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Enhance security by adding multi-factor authentication
- Require users to provide multiple forms of verification, such as a password and a temporary code sent to their mobile device or email, before granting access.
##### Third-Party Identity Providers

- Integrate your application with third-party identity providers (IdPs) like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft
- This allows users to log in using their existing credentials from these providers and is often used in conjunction with OAuth 2.0 or SAML.
##### Externalized Identity Services

- Consider using Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solutions that provide comprehensive identity and access management features, including authentication, authorization, and user management.
##### Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Implement SSO solutions that allow users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without re-entering credentials
- SSO can improve user convenience and security
- Okta, KeyCloak are some of the SSO solutions
