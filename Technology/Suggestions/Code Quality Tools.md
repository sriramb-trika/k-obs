To improve the code quality, the following tools are suggested.
##### SonarQube
- SonarQube is a widely used code quality and static analysis tool. It can analyze code for bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and enforce coding standards. It supports various languages including Java and provides detailed reports and metrics.
##### Checkstyle
- Checkstyle is a tool that enforces coding standards and style conventions in Java code. It can be configured to check for various coding violations and formatting issues.
##### PMD
- PMD is a source code analyzer that detects common coding problems like unused variables, inefficient code, and potential bugs. It supports Java and offers a wide range of rules.
##### FindBugs
- FindBugs is a static analysis tool that identifies potential bugs in Java code. It can help catch issues like null pointer dereferences, incorrect method calls, and more.
##### SpotBugs
- SpotBugs is a successor to FindBugs and continues to provide static analysis for finding bugs in Java code. It offers an updated set of rules and improvements over FindBugs.
##### IDE Plugins
- Many IDEs and editors offer plugins or extensions that integrate with various code quality tools, making it easier to analyze and improve your code directly within your development environment.
##### JUnit and Testing Tools
- While not exclusively code quality tools, using JUnit for unit testing and other testing frameworks can greatly contribute to code quality by ensuring your code behaves as expected.
##### Linters
- Linters like ESLint (for JavaScript) can help enforce coding standards and best practices for frontend code in J2EE applications.
##### Security Scanners
- Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Dependency-Track can help identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.

Some of these tools require licensing. Hence there would be a constraint on whether Kirklands would be able to invest in the tools for the [[Code Quality License]]
