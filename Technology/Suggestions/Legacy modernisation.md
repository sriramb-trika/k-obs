Here are some options for legacy modernisation for OCP
##### Microservices Architecture
- Break down the monolithic application into smaller, independent micro services using Spring Boot
- Each micro service can focus on specific business capabilities and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently 
- You can track the micro services by registering them in the service registry and authenticate them using a gate way
- This approach improves agility, scalability, and maintainability.
##### Strangler Pattern
- Gradually rewrite or replace parts of the application while keeping the existing system functional
- Over time, more and more functionality is migrated to the new architecture until the monolith is "strangled" and replaced entirely.
##### Containerisation and Orchestration
- Containerise the application using technologies like Docker. Deploy and manage the containers using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
- [[Containerisation]] simplifies deployment, scaling, and management, making the application more portable and resilient.
##### API-First Approach
- Expose functionality as APIs and encourage a separation of concerns
- This allows you to encapsulate different components and services, making them headless and accessible to other applications and systems.
##### Refactoring and Code Cleanup
- Perform code refactoring to improve the maintainability and readability of the codebase
- Break down large classes and methods, eliminate code duplication, and adhere to coding best practices
- Replace JSP with modern front-end frameworks like React, Next.js. This separation of concerns improves user experience and simplifies maintenance
##### Database Modernisation
- Update the database technology to a more modern and scalable solution. Consider migrating from relational databases to NoSQL databases or using cloud-based database services.
##### Cloud Adoption
- Migrate the application to the cloud, taking advantage of cloud services for scalability, availability, and cost savings. Leverage Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings for simplified infrastructure management.
- Automated Testing and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment [[CI & CD]]
- Implement automated testing to ensure code quality and reduce regression issues. Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process and enable frequent releases.
##### Re-platforming
- Move the application to a more modern application server or runtime environment. For example, migrate from traditional J2EE application servers to lightweight runtimes like Spring Boot or Jakarta EE.
##### Wrap with APIs
- Introduce APIs around existing functionality to make the application more extensible. This allows you to gradually replace parts of the monolithic application with new micro services.
##### Externalize Configuration
- Move configuration settings out of the codebase and into external configuration files or environment variables. This allows for easier configuration management and deployment across different environments.
##### Data Migration and ETL
- Migrate and transform data from legacy systems to modern data stores, data warehouses, or data lakes using Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes.
##### Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement monitoring, logging, and analytics to gain insights into the application's performance and user behavior, enabling data-driven improvements.
