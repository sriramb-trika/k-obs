- OCP being a legacy application, it has been documented and understood by only a few team members 
- As the application ages, the team periodically adds new functionality, but this often happens in a silo, and updates across the organisation and documentation are not guaranteed
- Hence, the domain knowledge, i.e., what functionality the application contains, is not present in all the testers in the team over a period of time
