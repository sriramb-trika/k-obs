##### XML 
- OCP commonly uses the XML for configuration and data interchange
- XML is more verbose than JSON, leading to larger file sizes and reduced human readability
- Parsing XML can be more complex and resource-intensive due to XML's nested structure, which requires more effort to traverse and extract data
- XML uses tags and attributes to define the structure, which can make the data harder to navigate and understand
- XML requires careful management of namespaces, which can lead to complexity and confusion, especially in large and nested documents 
- XML schemas (XSD/DTD) can be complex and challenging to maintain
- XML requires closing tags and quotes around attribute values, leading to more potential syntax errors and increased development time
- JSON is a native subset of JavaScript, making it a natural fit for web development and easier to work with in modern browser environments
- XML often requires additional parsing and manipulation
- XML's complex and verbose structure can lead to tight coupling between data and applications, making changes to the structure more challenging and potentially affecting multiple layers of an application
- XML schemas and structures can sometimes impose rigid constraints on data representation, limiting the flexibility to evolve the data model
- Parsing and processing XML documents can be slower and more resource-intensive compared to JSON, which can impact application performance

To replace the legacy XML dependencies, [[JSON]] can be considered and its benefits are listed
