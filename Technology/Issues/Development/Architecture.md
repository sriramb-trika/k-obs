Below are some of the disadvantages of using the current Architecture in OCP
##### Scalability
- The current architecture of OCP makes them difficult and expensive to scale
- OCP being monolithic, part of the system cannot be scaled up rather the entire system has to be scaled in the case of any performance issues
- This would lead to huge cost in the compute instances
- It would be even more challenging as the code is hosted on on-premise or in data centres. It can take more time to procure new hardware to scale up. There is no [[Elasticity]]
- Once provisioned, you are stuck with the hardware, even in times of low usage.
##### Complexity and Maintainability
- OCP has been written to be a one code solution, tend to become complex over time, making them difficult to maintain, extend, and modify
- As the application grows, the interdependencies between various components, including JSP pages and servlets led to tangled and hard-to-understand code
##### Deployment and Release Bottlenecks
- In OCP, any changes or updates to a single module require the entire application to be redeployed 
- This can lead to longer release cycles, increased risk of errors, and difficulties in managing updates
##### Flexibility and Agility
- It makes it harder to adopt with the latest development platform
- It can be challenging to experiment with new tools or techniques without affecting the entire application
##### Team Collaboration
- Different team members working on different parts of the application might have to coordinate closely, leading to slower development cycles and increased communication overhead.
##### Testing and Debugging
- Testing can be cumbersome, as changes in one part of the application might impact other areas
- Debugging can also be more challenging, especially when isolating issues within the tightly coupled components.
##### Vendor Lock-In
- It can become tightly coupled to specific technologies or vendor products, making it harder to switch or adopt new tools or platforms in the future.
##### Scalability and Performance Limitations
- As traffic increases OCP might face limitations in scaling horizontally. Additionally, we would be already struggling to take full advantage of modern distributed computing paradigms.
##### Resource Utilisation
- With the way how OCP is written, it could result in inefficient use of resources, as the entire application has to be loaded into memory, even if only specific components are actively used.
##### Difficulty in Embracing Modern Architectures
- It needs substantial refactoring to adopt micro services or other modern architectural patterns for [[Legacy modernisation]], making the transition more complex and time-consuming which current is ruled out
##### Lack of Agility and Innovation
- The nature of OCP code limits its innovation and experimentation, making it harder to adopt new practices, technologies, or development methodologies. The [[Software Licences]] is given for all the 3rd party integrations
##### Data Migration
- [[Data Migration]] can be a complex and challenging process due to the nature of the legacy systems, the variety of data sources, and the need to maintain data integrity and accuracy.
##### Authentication
In OCP, the username and password authentication is used. There are various [[Authentication]] mechanisms available today to address the authentication issues and migrating to the latest authentication features.
