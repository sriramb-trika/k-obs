- Containerisation is encapsulating software and all of its dependencies in a solitary, portable bundle.
- Beyond operating legacy Java in the context of a modern Java running time, Java containerisation offers.
##### Efficiency
- Containerised application's supporters focus on efficiency for **storage, CPU,** and **memory** compared to physical application hosting and traditional virtualisation.
- It is quite possible for supporting various other application containers inside a similar infrastructure without any overhead required via virtual machines
##### Portability
- Various application containers may execute on a cloud and system without requiring any code modifications when OS is similar across systems
##### Reproductivity
- The binaries, file systems, and other data remain the same throughout the lifecycle of an application through code create from production and test
- Each artifact of the development becomes a single image
- The configuration management on the system level can be replaced via the version control on the image level
