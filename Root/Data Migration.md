##### Data Complexity and Volume
- Legacy applications often accumulate large volumes of data over time. Migrating this data while ensuring its accuracy, completeness, and consistency can be challenging.
##### Data Quality and Cleansing
- Legacy data might have inconsistencies, duplicates, missing values, and other data quality issues that need to be addressed before migration.
##### Data Mapping and Transformation
- Mapping data between the legacy schema and the new schema can be complex, especially if the data models differ significantly.
##### Data Relationships and Dependencies
- Data in a legacy system might be interconnected, with complex relationships and dependencies. Ensuring these relationships are maintained correctly during migration is crucial.
##### Data Loss and Integrity
- Ensuring data integrity during migration is essential. Any data loss, corruption, or mismatch can have serious consequences for the application's functionality.
##### Performance Impact
- Data migration can impact application performance, especially if the migration process competes for resources with the live application.
##### Downtime and Availability
- Migrating data might require downtime or impact the availability of the application, which can be disruptive to users and business operations.
##### Legacy Data Formats
- Legacy systems might use proprietary or outdated data formats that need to be translated into modern formats during migration.
##### Data Security and Compliance
- Sensitive data, such as personal information, must be handled securely and in compliance with data protection regulations during migration.
##### Legacy System Compatibility
- Legacy systems might have limitations that affect data extraction and migration, requiring custom solutions or workarounds.
##### Testing and Validation
- Ensuring the correctness of the migrated data is critical. Comprehensive testing and validation procedures are needed to verify data accuracy and completeness.
##### User Impact and Training
- Migrated data might affect user interfaces, reports, and workflows. Users may need to be trained on how to use the updated data.
##### Data Source Unavailability
- Legacy data sources might become unavailable or difficult to access over time, making extraction and migration more challenging.
##### Lack of Documentation
- In many legacy systems, documentation might be lacking or outdated, making it harder to understand the data structures and relationships.
##### Custom Data Transformations
- Legacy applications might have implemented custom data transformations, calculations, or business rules that need to be replicated in the new system.
