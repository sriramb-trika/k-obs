## What is it?

- In automated testing, software tests and other sets of repeatable tasks can be performed without human interaction
- Furthermore, these tests can run frequently to ensure that your application performs as expected continuously
- This happens typically whenever the source code is updated
## Benefits

### Increased Accuracy

- When tests are automated, they run more frequently and with greater consistency than when running tests manually
- This can be beneficial when dealing with a large codebase or when new features are added
- automation testing helps ensure that any errors or defects in the code are identified and fixed as quickly as possible
### Faster execution

- Automated testing can also lead to faster execution of tests
- This is because the tests will run concurrently instead of serially
- Running tests concurrently means more tests run in a shorter amount of time
### Reduced costs

- Automated testing can also lead to reduced costs
- When tests are automated, the need for manual testers is reduced
- In addition, the time needed to execute tests is reduced, leading to savings in terms of both time and money
- Automated tests can help reduce the cost of software development by detecting and fixing errors earlier in the process
- They can also help reduce the cost of supporting your application, as automated tests will need less time to find and fix bugs.
